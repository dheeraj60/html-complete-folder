            Chicken dum biryani is goodness of rice and meat that comes in layers! 
            The process of cooking in it's own steam until rice is fluffy and meat cooked just to perfection
             is called 'dum cooking'. A lengthy cooking process but all totally worth it! 
             If you are biryani lover, don't miss vegetable biryani and egg biryani
