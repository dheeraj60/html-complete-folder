        <h2>Tips for Visiting Torres del Paine National Park, Chile</h2>
        <p id="para">
            As one of the most Southern National Parks in the world, Torres Del Paine is a place you’ll want to visit at least once in your life. Desolate, wild and unforgiving the Torres Del Paine is pure nature with scenery that will surprise, delight, and have you reaching for your camera again and again.

            Here in Patagonia, you’ll experience a different world, one that you’ll never want to leave once it’s captivated you with its magic. Having lived in Chile for the last 5 years, I’ve visited the park twice now, once trekking and once experiencing the park as part of a road trip and I’d highly recommend the former.

             Due to its extreme southern location, the Torres del Paine is a seasonal destination. Most people visit from December – February, during Chilean summer.

At this time, February especially, you can expect the park to be at its capacity with many people on the trails. The wind and rain can also be a problem in the park and the windiest and wettest months are January and March.

In my opinion, the best time to visit the park is at the beginning of December or at the beginning of March—most of the crowds have dispersed but it’s not yet too cold to not camp.

If you’re feeling brave, visiting in the winter (May-September) is also an option but you’ll have to stay in hotels rather than camp and be prepared for limited hours of daylight.

            From Santiago, the easiest way to get to Patagonia is to fly to Puerto Natales, the town closest to Torres del Paine National Park. LATAM, Sky Airline and JET Smart all offer flights to Puerto Natales, but only in the summer. If you’re traveling in the low season you’ll have to fly to Punta Arenas, and from there take a bus to Puerto Natales. The ride takes about 3 hours.

            If you’re arriving from El Calafate in Argentina, you can take a direct bus to Puerto Natales with a stop at the border.
            
            From Puerto Natales, there are many bus companies that shuttle people to and from the park. The journey takes about 3 hours to get to the start of the trails and buses leave in the morning and then again in the afternoon. In high season it’s worth reserving your ticket as soon as you can.

Outdoor & Waterproof Clothing:<br>
Whatever your itinerary you’ll need comfortable outdoor clothing for all seasons. You are more than likely to experience all four seasons in one day and it’s not unheard of for the temperature to fall to 40°F/5°C in the evenings in summer.

<br>If you’re trekking, a good pair of already worn-in hiking boots are essential.<br>

Camping Gear:<br>
If you’re doing the famous ‘O’ or ‘W’ treks and you choose to camp without having rented it out from the campsite, you’ll need all camping gear such as a tent, mattress, a winter sleeping bag, and cooking equipment. It’s worth having a high quality, waterproof tent as sometimes, the rain and wind are relentless.

If you don’t have your own camping gear but you still want to do some trekking, rental shops are available in Puerto Natales. Most gear rents for about $5 per item per day. You can also rent an already assembled tent, mattress, and sleep bag at the campsite and this can be booked when reserving accommodation.

            Food:<br>
            On the ‘O’ or ‘W’ treks, when you book them most campsites have a full board (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) or half board (lunch and dinner) option. Going for this will mean you’ll have to carry less weight and you get your meals cooked for you.
            
            You can also bring all your own food and cooking equipment and prepare it all yourself. This is perfect for those with a lower budget and wants more of a wild camping experience. Make sure you plan all your meals ahead and buy all your food in Puerto Natales.

            Other:<br>
            Headlamp — for moving around after dark.
            Kindle/Book, + Playing Cards — In the evenings there isn’t much to do so you’ll need to bring some entertainment. I’d highly recommend a Kindle- it’s lightweight and fits many titles onto it.
            Small Padlock — On the ‘W’ or ‘O’ trek you’ll be leaving your tent unattended a few times, bring a small padlock so you can lock your stuff inside.
            Reusable Water Bottle — There are water sources located at all the campsite so bring a reusable water bottle with you to avoid using plastic bottles.
            Camera — Needless to say the Torres del Paine is extremely photogenic so don’t forget your camera- you’ll have it in your hand most of the time.
