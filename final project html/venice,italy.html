        <h2>Tips for Visiting Venice in Italy</h2>
        <p id="para">
            Be ready for anything in Venice.
             This floating city consists of a group of 117 small islands separated by canals and linked by bridges. 
             It can be the most romantic place on earth, but it can also be terribly expensive and feel like a tourist trap 
             if you don't do your research.
             All you need to know is how to prepare correctly so Venice can live up to your expectations 
             and offer you luxury at an affordable price. Here are my best travel tips for visiting Venice in Italy.
             “If you go to Venice, book a flight and get a hotel somewhere in the city” -
            that's the worst advice anyone can give you.Specificity matters,
             you should pay close attention to which airport you're flying to 
             (VCE Marco Polo is great, but Treviso Airport is very far away).
             Also, it does matter where to stay, as you could easily end up VERY unhappy. 
             If you're going to book a hotel at the last minute you might end up staying over an hour away 
             from Venice due to the high demand.
             I'd avoid staying on the mainland, as it might take you up to an hour by bus to get to the part 
             of Venice you actually want to see.

             If you get lost (which happens to everyone in Venice) or you’re simply too tired of walking around you can hop on and off a Vaporetto. It’s a “water taxi” but I would rather call it a “water bus”.

It’s $24 for 12 hours of unlimited rides, $26 for 24 hours, and $33 for 36 hours. You don’t have to think twice about taking it only one stop, and you can also take it simply for the sightseeing. Compared to EUR 7.5 for a single ride, it’s a bargain!

            Venice is beautiful in the summer, but unfortunately, you’re not the only person who thinks so. Be prepared for a gorgeous, yet crowded experience with a lot of tourists running around.

It may seem like everywhere you go is full of people, especially between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. when the cruise ships pull in and take their passengers onshore for excursions to the museums in the Piazza San Marco.

Do yourself a favor and get skip the line tickets to major points of interest. It’s only a few bucks more, but it can save you a lot of time and frustration.

The further away you go from San Marco square the fewer people you’ll see. Get lost in the small streets to feel like a local. In the residential quarter around the Ormesini and Sensa canals at the northern end of Cannaregio, you can still enjoy a real slice of genuine Venetian life.

Best Times to Visit Venice:<br>

Carnival but during the week, not weekends (my absolute favorite time)<br>
early Spring<br>
When to Avoid:<br>

June & July<br>
November because of Aqua Alta (it can flood any time between mid-October to January, but Nov is the prime time)<br>

            Carnival weekends are insanely busy and experience, but during the week there aren’t many people and you can still see beautiful costumes and feel the atmosphere of the carnival. 
            What’s the first thing people think about when they hear about Venice? Gondolas! As I explained in my other post, gondolas cost 80 Euros for half an hour as they are regulated by the city. There’s no arguing over the price unless you pre-booked your gondola online.

            While I’m not saying it’s not worth it, in fact I highly recommend it, but it might not be for everyone because of the price. If you’re not willing to spend that much on a short gondola ride take a local boat. It looks like a gondola, but costs just a few Euros as it’s a local transportation and only lasts a few minutes.
            
            If you decide to ride a gondola, take a few things into consideration. A lot of other blogs will tell you that it costs more for your gondoliers to sing or to enter smaller canals – both things couldn’t be further away from the truth!
            
            As long as you avoid Canale Grande or start near Ponte Rialto (I highly recommend taking gondolas from a small canal next to Residenza Veneziana hotel. Otherwise, take a walk and shop around for your gondolier and you’ll have a great experience!)

            As in any other tourist destination, a lot of crappy souvenirs are sold in Venice. Most goods are made in other countries such as China and passed off as “Made in Italy”, so it’s always great to find a genuine Italian product.

For example, you can buy glass directly from Murano, known for its high-quality glassware. You can be taken to a glass-making factory where they put on a glass blowing demonstration for a few minutes before you are escorted into the gallery, but don’t take out your camera. Although no photos are allowed, you can bring a great glass souvenir home!
