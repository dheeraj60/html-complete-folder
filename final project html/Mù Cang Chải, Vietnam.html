        <h2>Tips for Visiting Mù Cang Chải, Vietnam</h2>
        <p id="para">
            Ever since I started seeing photos of Mu Cang Chai in Vietnam’s northern regions, it’s been on my list to visit! Now that I’ve made the journey and planned my own trip, I thought I’d share all my best tips.

            I feel like the minute I settled in to Saigon and started following different Vietnam photography accounts, I kept seeing these stunning golden rice terraces. Only instead of the geo-tags saying places in Sapa, the name “Mù Cang Chải” kept popping up. Where and what the heck was this place?!
            
            Turns out Mù Cang Chải is south of Sapa in the Yên Bái province and known for similar things — stunning rice field landscapes, ethnic minority tribes with their own culture and lifestyles, and lots of agriculture and farming. It sits below the Hoang Lien Son mountain range and is part of the Khau Phạ Pass for those of you looking for a motorbike ride.

                Unlike Sapa, though, Mù Cang Chải is much less touristed so if you really want to feel like you’ve gotten a bit lost in the Vietnamese countryside, this is the place to go! I decided to make my trip up from Saigon during the first week of October, hoping to catch the area in its most golden glory and spent a few days seeing as much as I could see. Here’s all I learned from my planning my trip.

<h2>My Best Mu Cang Chai Travel Tips
</h2>
        <p id="para">
            Weather & When to Go:<br>
            Unlike southern Vietnam, northern Vietnam does experience all four seasons. It’s kind of up to you to decide what you want to see:
            
            Winter (December – February) – rice fields are just giant pools of water and grass. I know it can snow in Sapa, not sure if it can snow in Mù Cang Chải too!
            Spring (March – May) – green fields, maybe some cherry blossoms, and cooler weather; best chance to avoid the rain
            Summer (June – August) – everything is super green and lush
            September – golden fields
            Autumn (October – November) – rice fields are beginning to be picked so it’s drier; you’ll see it more rugged and if you go in early October you might still see some yellow fields
            All my photos are from the first week of October, so hopefully that gives you an idea of what to expect! September is really the time to go if you want to see all the terraces in their golden glory, and I’ve heard it’s much more lively as everyone is out and about for harvest season.

    So when it comes to Mù Cang Chải, you have a few options, but not much. In my Facebook groups, the Ecolodge came recommended a lot and, of course, I found their commitment to actually being environmentally responsible promising!
    The lodge is only a few years old and was built to work with the landscape. All the materials used to build the bungalows are the same as used by the nearby Hmong and Thai minority groups. All the food you can get is made from local ingredients and all the guides and staff come from Mù Cang Chải itself. In fact, on my trek, my guide, Ba, pointed out his sister’s house as we walked by!
    Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. The owner, Mr. Dzung, speaks English as does a few of his staff, and everyone really was so lovely and friendly during my stay. Because the lodge is fairly small, they’re able to chat with you and help you plan exactly what you want to do. They helped me set up my itinerary of trekking and motorbiking with their own guides, who were awesome despite the fact that we really couldn’t communicate with each other without our Google Translate apps!

        <p id="para"> 
           The whole area you’ll wind up visiting is quite large! Most of my trips from the Ecolodge wound up being around an hour by motorbike and, obviously, longer by trek. Other areas you may want to stay in are La Pán Tẩn, Tú Lệ, or Ngọc Chiến Valley, which I’ll get into more in another section.

If you want to stay in La Pán Tẩn, La Pan Tan Paradise Lodge looks like a super nice option. It only has six rooms in all and Nam, the owner, is from northern Vietnam and has quite a few years with tourism experience.

For a “fancier” pick, your only option is really Le Champ Tú Lệ Resort, which is an hour from the Ecolodge. I’m not going to lie, it looks really, really nice and that infinity pool is calling my name. I had no idea the place existed when I was planning my trip, but I think if I go back, I’d splurge on a night there. Since it’s in Tú Lệ, it’s actually on the route back to Hanoi!

Other than that, the majority of accommodation options are homestays. They’re of course the most budget-friendly and they’re sprinkled all throughout the region. In fact, if you’re doing a more adventurous trip, with motorbiking and trekking, I’d recommend picking different ones to stay at to match your itinerary.

I decided if I go back, I’m motorbiking, and taking my sweet time to see pretty much everywhere I can along the way and just staying at random homestays as I go.

            Visit the Bamboo Forest
Your reward at the end of a very long trek is this beautiful, uphill bamboo forest! I actually remember getting to the bottom of the staircase and looking at Ba with a “Are you jokin’?” face haha. But I managed to climb up and enjoy the views!

It’s also a big photo spot with little zones, so we stumbled across a few groups in the midst of photoshoots! When I tell you I’ve never felt more underdressed in my life… especially as I was dripping with sweat by this point. Like I’m pretty sure they were asking Ba if I was okay whenever they talked lol.

If you don’t want to suffer through a trek to get here, you can, of course, visit via motorbike. This is the location to look for. Obviously, we were the only ones who arrived at the end of a long walk.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">That's all for now guys! Thank you for making it till the End! Have a nice trip </h2>
