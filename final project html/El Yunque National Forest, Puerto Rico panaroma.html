            El Yunque National Rainforest is a reserve located in the Sierra de Luquillo mountains. El Yunque is the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest System, with over 120 inches of rainfall in a year. Home to hundreds of unique plant and animal species, it features beautiful waterfalls, natural pools, hiking trails, camping areas, and historical sites.

            As a Puerto Rican local, Iâ€™ve been there multiple times, and I know there is a lot to see and do. In fact, El Yunque is high on my list of the top Puerto Rico attractions.
