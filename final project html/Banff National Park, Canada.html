        <h2>Tips for Visiting Banff National Park,Canada</h2>
        <p id="para">
            It’s hard to get anything better than Banff in the summer. The temperature is perfect, the sun is shining, and the famous glacial-fed blue lakes are sparkling.

            People flock all over the world to see the Canadian Rockies in the summer months. June through September is a busy time in the park, but there’s a good reason for it as all adventure activities are on offer.
            
            After spending a few summers in this stunning part of the world, here are my favorite summer activities in Banff.
            So what is there to do in Banff National Park in the summer? First up, is to visit Lake Minnewanka. One of the top things to do in Banff National Park is to stroll along or take a boat ride on Lake Minnewanka. Lake Minnewanka is one of the largest lakes in Canada that is just a ten-minute drive away from the town of Banff.

This man-made lake is 21 km long and 142 meters deep and helps power Banff with hydroelectric power. In the summer it’s a busy place to hike, picnic, canoe on, or even rent a motorboat. You can also hop on the popular boat cruises that take you to the lake’s start called the Devil’s Gap.

The mountains towering over Lake Minnewanka are seriously impressive all year round. Oh yea, and there’s also a Canadian resort ghost town under the lake. (Psst a great easy hike in the area is called the C-Level Cirque and gives amazing views over Minnewanka for low effort).

                Just a five-minute drive away from Lake Minnewanka is Two Jack Lake. It’s another fantastic lake with stunner Mount Rundle Views. Two Jack is one of the most photographed lakes in the Canadian Rockies, due to its proximity to Downtown Banff.

                It’s also my favorite spot to take the stand up paddleboard out on during a Banff summer. It has scenic views and isn’t as wind-affected as nearby Minnewanka.

            If there is a style of biking you enjoy you’ll find an abundance of scenic places to get on a bike in Banff in the summer. It doesn’t matter your skill level either as there truly is everything in the area. Head up the Bow Valley Parkway to Lake Louise on a road bike for one of the best rides of your life.

            Seriously it’s an amazing paved road that is great for cyclists. During the summer Banff runs an awesome “Bike to Beer” Trail. Ride the 58 km on the Bow Valley Parkway any day this summer, between Banff and the Summer Gondola in Lake Louise via the Bow Valley Parkway! Once finished show your Strave or Garmin activity to the staff at Banded Peak Base Camp for a free beer and Parkway to Pint t-shirt.
            
            If all of that sounds too much hop on the Legacy Trail and ride to Canmore for some beers at the Grizzly Paw Brewery. Or just rent some simple cruisers or an e-bike and enjoy the scenery around Banff town, like Bow Falls or Vermilion Lakes.
            
            If you want to mountain bike in Banff there are a few okay mountain bike trails, Look up Star Wars and Top Notch on Trailforks for an idea of what they are like.
            
            Though if you are a decent mountain biker I would suggest heading to the Canmore Nordic Center for a much better trail network. If you don’t have your own bike with you, you can rent one at Banff Cycle on Bear Street.

    Every summer until October 6th the Banff Famers Market runs on Wednesdays from 10-6. It’s a fantastic place to stop by and pick up some fresh fruits, vegetables, food trucks, jewelry and anything else you could want from local vendors. The Farmer’s Market happens in Banff Central Park at 110 Bear Street.

            One of the finest hikes in the Banff National Park is Healy Pass. The hike starting point is a short drive from the town of Banff and climbs a gradual pass until unveiling a pristine alpine meadow. It’s a relatively easy hike with not much elevation gain that spans many km – ultimately a great day out and where you can get all your wildflower feels in.

The meadow is resplendent for hiking and famed for wildflowers in the summer and is well worth a hike. There are quite a few storybook vistas in the park, but Healy Pass rivals the best of them.

            New in Summer 2021 is this awesome art installation right in the heart of Banff townsite. This trails along the Bow River from July to September. You’ll see 30 art installations along a walking trail. Each of the installations has been created by regional artists. This is a fun free thing to do in Banff in the summer for the entire family.
