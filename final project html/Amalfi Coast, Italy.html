        <h2>Tips for Visiting Amalfi Coast, Italy</h2>
        <p id="para">
            There’s a reason the Amalfi Coast is on many of our travel bucket lists. While I would certainly recommend popular Italian cities like Rome, Florence, and Venice, the Amalfi Coast has its own unique magic.

            Some of the Amalfi Coast’s most popular destinations are Amalfi, Sorrento, Salerno, Positano, Ravello, Praiano, and Maiori. And, of course, you can easily pop over to the island of Capri by ferry.
            
            Wind through the narrow roads as you overlook the seaside cliffs from Sorrento to Positano. Sail along the incredible coastline at sunset. Stop for the most beautiful hike of your life then fill up on heavenly lemon desserts. For more delights, here are the best things to do on the Amalfi Coast!

             There are a few different ways to explore the Amalfi Coast: taking a train and then a bus, hiring a private bus, or ferrying in. 

If you’re coming from elsewhere in Italy, I would recommend taking the train into Naples, then transferring to the regional train: the Circumvesuviana.

This is this railway service running through the area east of Naples. It’s operated by EAV Ente Autonomo Volturno so you can get all of the scheduling details there.

The Circumvesuviana train line is a bit rough around the edges but efficiently connects Naples with Herculaneum, Pompeii, and Sorrento. Once you get into Sorrento, there are local buses that will take you to popular spots like Positano

            There are options for private buses, too. Positano Shuttle Bus will take you from Naples Central Train Station to Positano for €35 then drop you right off at your hotel. While you can get a private bus from Rome, it’s a bit pricey.

            The public bus system is a cheap and efficient way to get between the little towns of the Amalfi Coast—and locals do it all the time.
            
            Just remember to come ready for the winding roads! It is a bit of a rough ride and far from luxe but it will take you where you want to go.
            
            When you arrive on the Amalfi Coast, get a SITA bus pass. You can get a 24-hour ticket for less than 10 USD that will take you through all the quaint little towns on the coast. Simply hop on the bus in front of the Sorrento train station and buy a ticket from the driver. You can usually purchase tickets at tobacconists, newsstands and some bars/cafes, too.

While it’s easy to find your way around and the buses are clearly marked, come ready for a crowd! The bus out of Sorrento to Amalfi only comes once an hour and you’ve got to be in line to get on board. From Positano to Amalfi, sometimes it’s so crowded they don’t even stop…be prepared as you’re going to have to run on Italian time.

            The high season for visiting the Amalfi Coast runs between June to August. While the weather is flawless, the crowds (and the prices!) can get a bit overwhelming. This is especially true in iconic towns like Positano and Amalfi.

            If you can make it happen, the best time to visit the Amalfi Coast is during the spring or autumn. All of Italy is in top form, especially near the coast where waters are the ideal temp.
            
            Best of all, Italian food is at its prime in spring and autumn. Local dishes make heavy use of whatever is in season and, at this time of year, we’re talking black truffles, mushrooms, and chestnuts.

            Italy has some of the best food on earth. I’ve talked to you before about how to eat like a local in Italy and chowing down is at the heart of every good celebration is a good meal—even if you’re just celebrating a Tuesday night!

On nearly every menu along the Amalfi Coast, you’ll find spaghetti alle vongole (spaghetti with fresh clams).

After you get loaded up on carbs, treat yourself to one of the many local lemon desserts. From classic lemon cakes to limoncello, you’ve got to get at least a bit of all of them.

In typical laid-back Southern European style, it’s also essential to plan ample time to linger over coffee and people watch. The charming plazas under the shade of huge churches are just what you need to refresh.
