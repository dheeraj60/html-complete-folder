            Hi folks! 
Here it's your Dheeraj! Probably you don't know me... And I don't know you... But anyways thanks for checking out on my lil project! 
There is nothing much to tell about me. In simple words, a enthusiastic guy who does anything if he gets interest in something or if he gets rewards for them.. hehe! But I interfere every single topic which I come across, but ofc I'll forget everything after a long time. I love sweets, playing video games, main point to be noted - anime freak! . I love to listen music whenever i get bored and i rarely speak to anyone in online... If it's offline it's completely another story ^_^ lol. 
Wanna ping me? Here are my social media ID's!
