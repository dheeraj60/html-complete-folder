        <h2>Tips for Visiting Blue Lagoon, Iceland</h2>
        <p id="para">
            The Blue Lagoon is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Iceland. The steamy milky blue water against the black lava rock landscape creates an otherworldly setting like no other. Sitting in the hot waters of the geothermal spa can be a truly intoxicating and relaxing experience.

            Its proximity to both the Keflavik Airport and Reykjavik make it a perfect pit stop even if you are only in Iceland for a short layover. In fact, it is the mostly commonly visited paid attraction in Iceland.
            
            Of course, the Blue Lagoon is not for everyone and is an expensive spa considering that there are hundreds of less expensive spas and thermal pools in Iceland.

            The Blue Lagoon, or Bláa Lónið in Icelandic, is Iceland’s most popular geothermal spa and the most visited paid attraction in Iceland. It’s famous for its steamy milky blue water contrasted against the black rocks of the surrounding lava fields of the region.

Despite its organic looking appearance and being listed as a top “natural attraction” by many travel sites and magazines, the Blue Lagoon is not really a natural attraction. The lagoon is fed by runoff water from the nearby Svartsengi geothermal power plant, making it a sort of quasi-natural attraction. The Blue Lagoon contains both seawater and freshwater of geothermal origin.
The water in the Blue Lagoon hovers around 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), and both the water and the mud in the pool are rich in minerals like silica and sulfur. The mineral-rich waters are believed to have therapeutic properties, especially for sufferers of psoriasis and eczema.

            The Blue Lagoon’s creation was purely by accident as it is fed by the runoff water from the Svartsengi geothermal power plant. The Svartsengi Power Station opened in 1976, and by 1977 the pools began to form.

The Svartsengi Power Plant is a significant power source in Iceland and was the world’s first geothermal power plant for electric power generation and hot water production for district heating. It is still used to heat thousands of households located on the Reykjanes Peninsula.

In the early 1980’s, a few men with psoriasis, such as Valur Margeirsson and Gísli Kristjánsson, started bathing in the waters and reported that it had helped alleviate their symptoms. By the late 1980’s it had become a popular local bathing area for those with skin diseases and later a clinic was established there in 1994.

            The most popular thing to do inside the Blue Lagoon is to simply soak in the warm milky water while enjoying the unusual scenery and atmosphere. Stand beneath the waterfall and let the hot water pound your shoulders, enjoy a silica mud face mask, take shelter in the steam cave, and have a drink at the swim-up bar.

            Your entrance includes a free drink from the swim-up bar, so you can relax and enjoy your beverage in the water. There are also mud mask bars where you can coat your face in the mineral rich mud. For an extra fee you can get a massage while floating in the water.
            
            Outside of the water, you can visit the sauna and steam room. There is also a relaxing viewing area with chairs where you can rest and look out over the lagoon. Note that there is limited space in these areas so you may need to wait your turn if the Blue Lagoon is busy during your visit.
            
            There is also a full service spa, restaurants, snack bar, and a gift shop on site.
