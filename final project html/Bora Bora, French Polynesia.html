        <h2>Tips for Visiting Bora Bora, French Polynesia</h2>
        <p id="para">
            The idyllic French Polynesian island of Bora Bora is a haven for honeymooners, but this romantic vacation spot for couples in the South Pacific Ocean is an equally spectacular destination for families too. Many Bora Bora resorts offer kid-friendly activities and their spacious accommodations allow even large families to spread out. White sand beaches deliver opportunities for building sandcastles and crystal-clear lagoons provide a safe space for kids to swim in calm water. 

However, Bora Bora certainly isn't the cheapest destination for a family vacation, After all, it can be hard to find affordable transoceanic flights to reach this remote destination. On top of that, the best Bora Bora resorts are pricey, especially if you splurge on a classic overwater bungalow.

But if you’re looking for family vacation ideas in an out-of-this-world tropical location that will impress everyone from toddlers to teenagers, these kid-friendly Bora Bora hotels should be at the top of your bucket list. 

All of these resorts are located in Bora Bora unless otherwise noted.
